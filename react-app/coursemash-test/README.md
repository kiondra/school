COURSE MASH

#CourseMash is a community-based collaboration web application software designed for students. When it comes to studying whether it’s online or on campus in a classroom, connecting with fellow students in today’s busy world can often be a challenge especially when taking online classes. CourseMash is a platform that offers students the ability to be able to communicate with each other through chat forums, the ability form private study groups, share documents for group projects, share success tips for future students new to the class, and when feeling overwhelmed even alert other students when they need help.  Users can view sample project ideas from previous students to help stimulate their creative juices. CourseMash users will be able to login to the web app through their school email address, access courses based on the university, course name and number. Due to the fact that often times no two professors teach the same nor have the course structured the same, the courses are also grouped by professors.  CourseMash aims to create a positive free interactive space where students can come together and offer support for each. All of the data within CourseMash is user-generated and user maintained.  Students can access and participate in multiple courses at a time.
